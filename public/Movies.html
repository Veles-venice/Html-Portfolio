    <h1>The Best Movies According To Veles</h1>
    <p>Well let's see my taste first before jumping straight into movies.<br>
    Though I mostly watch with a really deep concept like in romance and in thriller. So, My horrers are also leaning a bit towards psychological stuff.</p>
    <h2>My Top 3's</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Fight Club</h3>
    <p>So, generic answer isn't it? Well why won't it be, It's the one of the best psychological movie. I've seen a lot and maybe will see a lot compared to till now this one should have a seat in the bests. It has the thriller wibe, good characters and a villan who's right.</p>
    <h3>500 Days Of Summer</h3>
    <p>Oh! We all have seen it and it's no denying that this is one of the best movies which have a good insight on psychological aspect of the relationship world. The non-linear plot ? Oh don't say it how I scratched my head when I first saw something like it.</p>
    <h3>Midosommer</h3>
    <p>Oh It's the best psychological horrer out there. The thing that sets apart it from all is how errie it feels to watch it eventhough it's a movie that goes on in the morning time only. You need some rock heart if you're gonna watch it.</p>
