<h1>About Me </h1>
<p>I'm Veles, a self-taught frontend developer who believes clean code and thoughtful design can create meaningful digital experiences<br> When I'm not wrestling with JavaScript or perfecting UI interactions, you'll find me immersed in my many passions—each one shaping how I think, create, and solve problems.</p>
<h2>Hobbies & Interests:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Art & Illustration.: A former teen artist with a sketchbook full of untold stories.</li>
    <li>Poetry & Novel Writing.: Secretly crafting verses and manuscripts (Never Posted but Two novels tucked away).</li>
    <li>Manga Art.: Dabbles in panels and storytelling, paused for life’s "adulting" phase.
    <li>Fitness.: A gym attempt cut short by finals, but the intention still counts.</li>
    <li>Reading.: Devouring books between coding sessions—fiction, tech, and everything in between.</li>
    <li>Movies.: A certified enthusiast with opinions on camera angles and bad endings.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all about me as I hardly know What to write in it so yeah.....</p>
